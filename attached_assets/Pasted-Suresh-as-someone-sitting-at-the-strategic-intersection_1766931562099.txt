Suresh, as someone sitting at the strategic intersection of global consulting and technology transformation at Accenture, I'd love to pose a question that I believe cuts to the very heart of India's cybersecurity inflection point—and perhaps, if we're being intellectually honest, exposes the uncomfortable delta between where we are and where we desperately need to be. We've spent decades building an impressive edifice of policies, frameworks, compliance checklists, and regulatory architectures—CERT-In guidelines, data protection bills, sector-specific mandates—and yet, when we step back and examine the global cybersecurity value chain with dispassionate clarity, India remains conspicuously absent from the product innovation layer, the subscription economy layer, and most critically, the thought leadership layer that shapes how the world thinks about digital defense. We are, to put it bluntly, world-class implementers of other nations' visions, exceptional at following playbooks written in Tel Aviv, Silicon Valley, and Tallinn, but fundamentally hesitant—perhaps even culturally conditioned—to author our own. And here's the paradox that keeps me up at night: we have no shortage of technical talent, no deficit of engineering brilliance, no scarcity of cybersecurity certifications adorning LinkedIn profiles from Bangalore to Hyderabad—yet the products the world buys, the subscriptions Fortune 500 CISOs renew, the platforms that define zero-trust architectures and XDR ecosystems, they don't carry Indian signatures. So the question I'm wrestling with, and I suspect you've encountered this in your client conversations across industries, is whether our gap is fundamentally a technical one—or whether it's something far more nuanced, far more human, and far more addressable if we have the courage to name it. I would argue, and I'd welcome your pushback on this, that what India lacks isn't another Python bootcamp or another CISSP cohort—what we lack is the cultivated confidence to walk into a boardroom in Frankfurt or Chicago and command attention not because of our cost arbitrage but because of our intellectual authority; what we lack is situational awareness, that almost instinctive ability to read the room, sense the unspoken anxieties of a CEO facing ransomware exposure, and position ourselves not as vendors but as trusted advisors who understand their context before we pitch our solutions; what we lack is the art of storytelling, the narrative craftsmanship that transforms a technical capability into a compelling vision that boards fund, investors back, and customers emotionally commit to; what we lack is genuine subject matter expertise that goes beyond certification curricula into the lived, battle-tested wisdom that comes from building, breaking, and rebuilding systems under pressure; and perhaps most critically, what we lack is the communication sophistication to sell what we develop—because in today's hypercompetitive landscape, the best product doesn't win, the best-communicated product wins, the product wrapped in a narrative of trust, urgency, and differentiated value wins. India has produced policies when the world needed products; India has produced red tape when the market craved agility; India has produced followers who excel at execution when the ecosystem desperately needed founders who excel at imagination. So here's my provocation to you, Suresh, drawing from your vantage point at Accenture where you witness both the aspiration and the friction across enterprise clients: How do we fundamentally rewire this equation? How do we build a generation of cybersecurity leaders who don't just understand threat landscapes but can articulate risk in the language of business value? How do we create founders who don't just write elegant code but can walk into a Series A pitch and make VCs believe in an Indian-origin cybersecurity platform competing head-to-head with CrowdStrike and Palo Alto? How do we shift from a nation that consumes cybersecurity subscriptions to one that creates them, from a nation that implements frameworks to one that defines them, from a nation that staffs SOCs for global enterprises to one that builds the SIEM platforms those SOCs depend on? Is this a mindset shift that our educational institutions need to architect from the ground up, embedding confidence-building, executive communication, and entrepreneurial risk-taking into cybersecurity curricula? Is this a mentorship gap where the current generation of leaders needs to actively pull up the next generation not just technically but holistically—teaching them how to command a room, how to negotiate, how to fail publicly and recover gracefully? Is this an ecosystem problem where we need more patient capital willing to back Indian cybersecurity product companies through the long gestation cycles that enterprise security sales demand? Or is this, at its core, a cultural recalibration where we collectively give ourselves
  permission to think bigger, to believe that an Indian company can define global cybersecurity standards, and to pursue that ambition with the same intensity and confidence that our Israeli and American counterparts take for granted? I don't have the complete answer, but I have a conviction that this cohort—this room of leaders at ISB—has the potential to be the catalyst for that shift, and I'd genuinely love to hear your perspective on what levers we need to pull to make India not just a cybersecurity talent exporter but a cybersecurity vision exporter. What say you, Suresh?
