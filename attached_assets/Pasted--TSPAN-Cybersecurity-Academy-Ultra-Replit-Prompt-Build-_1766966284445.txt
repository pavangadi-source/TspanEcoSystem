  Build TSPAN Cybersecurity Academy — a comprehensive, enterprise-grade Learning Management System (LMS) modeled after ISB's Canvas-based executive education platform, designed to transform technology leaders into cybersecurity strategists through an 11-module curriculum covering Introduction to Cybersecurity, Cybersecurity Regulations and Compliance (Parts I & II covering IT Act 2000, CERT-In, DPDP Act, GDPR, and ISO/IEC standards), Security Strategy and IT Infrastructure (Parts I & II including risk assessment, asset classification, ethical hacking, and bug bounty programs), Incident Response and Crisis Management, Business Continuity and Disaster Recovery (BCDR), Artificial Intelligence in Cybersecurity (Parts I & II covering supervised/unsupervised/reinforcement learning, neural networks, and ML algorithms for threat detection), Generative AI and Cybersecurity (addressing deepfakes, AI hallucinations, and LLM security risks), and Emerging Technologies and Tools (IoT, blockchain, and
  AI tool demonstrations).

  Platform Architecture: Build using Next.js 14+ with Supabase for authentication and PostgreSQL database, implementing a complete module-based learning system where each module contains multiple content types: Pages (viewable content with "ViewMust view in order to complete" and "Viewed" states), Videos (embedded player with duration display like "Video 1 (03:38): Module Overview"), Quizzes (practice quizzes with 0 pts and graded quizzes with point values, states including "SubmitMust submit" and "Submitted"), Assignments (Required Assignments worth 10-20 pts, Self-Study Assignments worth 0 pts, and Reflection Activities with pre-video prompts), Discussion Topics (with "ContributeMust contribute" and "Contributed" states for peer engagement), and Reading Resources (additional materials and case studies); implement sequential unlocking where content must be completed in order with visual indicators showing Module In Progress, Complete All Items requirements, and individual item
  completion states (ViewedModule item has been viewed and is complete, SubmittedModule item submitted and is complete, ContributedContributed to this module item and is complete).

  Course Structure per Module: Each weekly module (requiring 5-6 hours) must include: a Week Introduction and Instructions page, 9-13 video lessons with timestamps, 2-4 reading resources with real-world case studies (like "Top Five Most Breached Countries in 2023", "Equifax Data Breach Analysis", "India's Cybersecurity Governance"), 1-2 discussion topics for peer learning, 1 self-study assignment for independent exploration, 1 required graded assignment (10-20 points), 1 practice quiz (0 pts for self-assessment), a Resources section containing Additional Readings, Summary Deck and Transcripts, Q&A Discussion Board, and a Feedback Survey; implement Context Module Sub Headers to organize content sections within modules; add special content types including Polls (like "Poll 8.1: Use of AI for Cybersecurity"), Knowledge Checks, Try-It Activities (hands-on exercises like "Simulating Cybersecurity Defenses with ChatGPT"), and Pre-video Reflection Activities that prompt thinking before watching
   explanatory videos.

  Programme Orientation Module: Create a comprehensive onboarding experience with: Programme Introduction and Information, Navigating the Platform tutorial, Meet the Faculty page with instructor bios and credentials, Meet Your Programme Leader section, Meet Your Fellow Learners discussion for cohort introductions, FAQs page, System Requirements and Tools, Programme Outline, and Completion Requirements; implement Pre-programme Learner Expectations with Student Code of Conduct and Programme Agreement quiz, Test Your Understanding of Plagiarism assessment, and Pre-Programme Survey for baseline data collection; add a Legal Name Survey for certificate generation.

  Capstone Project System: Implement a two-part capstone spanning multiple modules: Capstone Part A (Module 6): Developing a Cybersecurity Framework, and Capstone Part B (Module 10): Advanced Cybersecurity Strategy; these should be comprehensive projects requiring students to synthesize learning across modules with detailed rubrics, peer review options, and instructor feedback mechanisms.

  Progress Tracking Dashboard: Build a student dashboard showing: overall programme completion percentage, module-by-module progress with visual progress bars, upcoming deadlines with due dates (display format: "Oct 15", "Nov 26", "Jan 7, 2026"), items requiring attention (unviewed pages, unsubmitted quizzes, discussions needing contribution), learning streak tracking, time spent per module, and grade book showing points earned on required assignments; implement a left sidebar navigation matching Canvas-style with: Home, Modules, People, Discussions, Announcements, Live Sessions, Assignments, Grades, My Bookmarks, and Support links.

  Content Delivery Features: For video content, implement an embedded player with: playback speed controls, closed captions/transcripts, progress tracking that marks videos viewed after 90% completion, and timestamps displayed in format "(MM:SS)"; for discussions, create threaded conversation views with instructor responses highlighted, upvoting, and rich text formatting with code blocks for technical discussions; for assignments, implement file upload with drag-and-drop, text submission with rich editor, rubric display, and submission confirmation with timestamp; for quizzes, support multiple question types (multiple choice, true/false, short answer, matching) with immediate feedback on practice quizzes and delayed feedback on graded assessments.

  Curriculum Content Areas: Structure the 11 modules to cover: (1) CIA Triad, ISMS standards, cybersecurity culture and strategy development; (2) India's IT Act 2000, CERT-In regulations, IT Amendment Act 2008, IT Rules 2011 and 2021; (3) National Cybersecurity Policy 2013, Digital India Act 2023, NCIIPC, international data protection laws (GDPR, CCPA); (4) Security policy development, risk identification, security awareness training, incident response planning, continuous monitoring architecture; (5) Critical asset identification and classification, qualitative and quantitative asset valuation, vulnerability assessment, ethical hacking, and bug bounty programs; (6) Business Impact Analysis, IR lifecycle (Preparation, Detection, Containment, Eradication, Recovery, Lessons Learned), ransomware and phishing incident handling, crisis communication and PR; (7) BCDR planning and activation, disaster classification, DR process and strategies, BC strategies and timing; (8) AI/ML fundamentals,
  supervised learning (classification, regression), unsupervised learning (clustering, anomaly detection), CVE/CWE/NVD demonstration; (9) Reinforcement learning for adaptive security, neural networks and deep learning, CNN and NLP applications, LIWC demonstration, ethical considerations in AI/ML implementation; (10) Generative AI applications, deepfakes, AI hallucination risks, prompt injection attacks, regulatory frameworks for AI; (11) Hands-on demonstrations with ChatGPT, Copilot, blockchain, Speechify, Synthesia, and GitHub for security applications.

  Assessment & Grading: Implement a comprehensive grading system with: Required Assignments (total ~150 points across programme), Practice Quizzes (0 points, unlimited attempts, immediate feedback), Discussion Participation (completion-based, not points), Self-Study Assignments (0 points, completion tracking), Weekly Feedback Surveys (required for module completion), and Capstone Project (significant weight); display grades in a grade book with running totals, individual assignment scores, and exportable transcripts.

  Enterprise Features: Add cohort management for batch-based learning with synchronized start dates, deadline management across time zones, team progress dashboards for enterprise admins, completion certificates with digital verification, integration with HR systems for learning credit tracking, and white-label customization for enterprise clients; implement announcement system for programme updates, live session scheduling with calendar integration (Zoom/Google Meet), and a Support ticketing system.

  UI/UX Design: Create a clean, professional interface with dark mode option, using a left sidebar for course navigation (collapsible on mobile), breadcrumb navigation showing current location, module accordion views with expand/collapse functionality, visual completion indicators (checkmarks for completed items, circles for pending), color-coded status badges (green for complete, yellow for in progress, gray for locked), and responsive design that works seamlessly on desktop, tablet, and mobile; implement a sticky header with course title, user profile dropdown, notification bell with unread count, and quick search functionality.

  The Vision: TSPAN Cybersecurity Academy transforms how organizations develop cybersecurity leadership, taking executives from foundational concepts through advanced AI-powered threat detection and emerging technology risks, with a curriculum designed by industry experts that mirrors the rigor of ISB's executive education while being accessible to working professionals — every module builds strategic thinking, every assignment applies to real-world scenarios, and every graduate emerges as a certified cybersecurity leader ready to protect their organization in an era of sophisticated AI-powered threats, deepfakes, and nation-state attacks; this platform should feel like attending a premier business school's cybersecurity programme, with the convenience of online learning and the depth of in-person executive education, ultimately producing alumni who can develop cybersecurity frameworks, lead incident response, ensure regulatory compliance across global jurisdictions, and leverage AI/ML
  for proactive threat defense.
